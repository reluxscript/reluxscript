 Summary: Playground Integration

  I've integrated a playground into your existing site at J:\projects\relux\reluxscript\site. Here's what was done:

  Files Created/Modified:

  1. source/src/wasm.rs - WASM bindings that expose compile_reluxscript() function
  2. source/Cargo.toml - Added WASM dependencies (wasm-bindgen, serde-wasm-bindgen) and wasm feature
  3. source/src/lib.rs - Added pub mod wasm with #[cfg(feature = "wasm")]
  4. site/src/main.js - Added "Playground" link to navigation
  5. site/playground.html - Full playground UI with 3-panel editor (Input, Babel, SWC)
  6. site/PLAYGROUND_BUILD.md - Build instructions

  To Build and Run:

  # 1. Install wasm-pack
  cargo install wasm-pack

  # 2. Build WASM module
  cd source
  wasm-pack build --target web --features wasm,codegen --out-dir ../site/public/pkg

  # 3. Run dev server
  cd ../site
  npm run dev

  # 4. Visit playground
  # Open http://localhost:5173/playground.html

  Features:

  - 3-panel editor: ReluxScript input (.lux) → Babel output → SWC output
  - Syntax highlighting: CodeMirror with Monokai theme
  - Real-time compilation: Compiles in browser using WASM
  - Error display: Shows compilation errors inline
  - Matches site theme: Same cyan/gold gradient design
  - Integrated navigation: Links back to main site

  The playground runs entirely client-side - no server needed for compilation!
